Git commands to add all files in staging area, commit to move changes from the staging area and push those changes to the main repository are:

1. make the changes to all the necessary files of the repository, and add all files to staging area using command:

     git add .

This command basically adds all the files to staging area in which changes are made.

2. commit the changes and add a commit message using command:

      git commit -m "type your message"

3. finally, push the changes to remote repository using command:

        git push origin master
